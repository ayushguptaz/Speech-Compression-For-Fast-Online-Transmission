# Speech-Compression-For-Fast-Online-Transmission
- Implemented speech compression algorithm using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) technique and encoding
- Applied thresholding, run-length and huffman encoding to reduce the size of the speech signal while maintaining quality
- Calculated Performance Measures and implemented the algorithm using Python code to process a
